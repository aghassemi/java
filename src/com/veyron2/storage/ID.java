/**
 * ID is the type of keys for the key/value store.  The key is a numeric
 * identifier that is globally unique, meaning that if two stores contain an
 * entry with the same ID, then the entries represent the same thing.  To
 * ensure uniqueness, stores create unique IDs that have never before been used
 * as identifier.  The ID is large enough that collisions are extremely
 * unlikely.
