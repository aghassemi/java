/**
 * ChainPublicID represents the chain implementation of PublicIDs from veyron/runtimes/google/security.
 * It consists of a chain of certificates such that each certificate is signed using the private key
 * of the previous certificate (i.e., issuer). The certificate's signature is over its contents along
 * with the signature of the issuer certificate (this is done to bind this certificate to the issuer
 * chain). The first certificate of the chain is "self signed". The last certificate's public key is
 * considered the PublicID's public key. The chain of certificates, if valid, effectively binds a chain
 * of names to the PublicID's public key.
