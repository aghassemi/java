/**
 * Package wire defines the wire types of veyron security primitives.
 *
 * It defines types for representinve ECDSA public keys, signatures, caveats
 * and identity implementations. It also provides methods for encoding/decoding
 * these primitives into the higher level, language specific types. For example,
 * converting the wire representation of an ECDSA public key to a Go object
 * of type crypto.ecdsa.PublicKey.
