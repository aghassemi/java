// affect the mount itself or does it affect the service endpoint that the
// mount points to?  The chosen behavior is that it affects the service
// endpoint.  To modify the mount point's ACL, use ResolveToMountTable
// to get an endpoint and call SetACL on that.  This means that clients
// must know when a name refers to a mount point to change its ACL.
