/**
 * Binary can be used to store and retrieve veyron application
 * binaries.
 *
 * To create a binary, clients first invoke the Create() method that
 * specifies the number of parts the binary consists of. Clients then
 * uploads the individual parts through the Upload() method, which
 * identifies the part being uploaded. To resume an upload after a
 * failure, clients invoke the UploadStatus() method, which returns a
 * slice that identifies which parts are missing.
 *
 * To download a binary, clients first invoke Stat(), which returns
 * information describing the binary, including the number of parts
 * the binary consists of. Clients then download the individual parts
 * through the Download() method, which identifies the part being
 * downloaded. Alternatively, clients can download the binary through
 * HTTP using a transient URL available through the DownloadURL()
 * method.
 *
 * To delete the binary, clients invoke the Delete() method.
