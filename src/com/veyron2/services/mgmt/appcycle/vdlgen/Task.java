/**
 * Task is streamed by Stop to provide the client with a sense of the progress
 * of the shutdown.
 * The meaning of Progress and Goal are up to the developer (the server provides
 * the framework with values for these).  The recommended meanings are:
 * - Progress: how far along the shutdown sequence the server is.  This should
 *   be a monotonically increasing number.
 * - Goal: when Progress reaches this value, the shutdown is expected to
 *   complete.  This should not change during a stream, but could change if
 *   e.g. new shutdown tasks are triggered that were not forseen at the outset
 *   of the shutdown.
