 * peers.

 * It contains log related metadata: DevID is the id of the
 * device that created the log record, GNum is the ID of the
 * generation that the log record is part of, LSN is the log
 * sequence number of the log record in the generation GNum,
 * and RecType is the type of log record.
 *

 * in the store: ObjID is the id of the object that was
 * updated. CurVers is the current version number of the
 * object. Parents can contain 0, 1 or 2 parent versions that the
 * current version is derived from, and Value is the actual value of
 * the object mutation.
