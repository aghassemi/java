/**
 * Package syncgroup provides the means for Stores to set up SyncGroups for
 * subsequent synchronization of objects between them.
 * 
 * The intent is that SyncGroup objects are created and administered by
 * SyncGroup servers, even though they are subsequently mirrored among SyncGroup
 * members by the normal synchronization mechanisms.
 * 
 * SyncGroupServer also aids in discovering members of a particular SyncGroup.
 * SyncGroupServer maintains the names of joiners for a SyncGroup that are in
 * turn accessible to all members.  Each SyncGroup is also associated with a
 * set of mount tables.  A Store that joins a SyncGroup must advertise its name
 * (and optionally its SyncGroups) in these mount tables.  Stores are expected
 * also optionally to advertise the SyncGroups they join in the local
 * neighbourhood.
